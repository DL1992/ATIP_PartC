So who are we?

Vald sergianko & Doron laadan, 
2 sophomores students in ben gurion university of the negev 
in the Dept. of Software and Information Systems Engineering.

Our life wish was to design the most amazing and wonderful
maze game for the world!

We were very dedicating to our mission and so 
we worked hard for an entire week!(or so..) to create this game,
which used the most complex and cool algorithms you have ever see
(they are ground breaking really).

We are professional in our respected fields and can make any 
task look really damn easy if we want to.

Baseically we are AWESOME. 
If you enjoy the game we can die in peace.
